Task 7 – Suspicious Firefox Extension Removal

Browser: Mozilla Firefox

Today I checked all the extensions installed on my Firefox browser to find anything suspicious. I opened the extensions manager using `about:addons` and carefully reviewed each one.

🔍 Suspicious Extension Found:
Name: PDF Converter Pro  
Issue:
- Had access to all website data (unnecessary for a PDF tool).
- No proper publisher info.
- Found multiple Reddit posts and forums warning about hidden tracking.
- I didn’t even remember installing it.

✅ Action Taken:
I removed the extension immediately and restarted my browser.

💡 What I Learned:
This task made me realize how easy it is to install shady add-ons without thinking. I’ll now always check permissions and reviews before adding anything new. Better to be safe than sorry.
