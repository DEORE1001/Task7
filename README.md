# Task 7 – Suspicious Firefox Extension Removal

## Overview
This task was about identifying risky browser extensions and understanding how they can affect security. I focused on Firefox for this.

## What I Did
- Opened `about:addons` in Firefox.
- Reviewed all extensions and their permissions.
- Found one sketchy extension called **“PDF Converter Pro”**.
  - It asked for access to all website data.
  - Very few user reviews and some Reddit threads flagged it as suspicious.
- I removed it and restarted Firefox.

## What I Learned
- Some extensions look useful but act like spyware.
- Always check what permissions are being asked.
- Avoid extensions that need access to *everything*.

## Removed Extension
- **PDF Converter Pro** – excessive permissions, unclear source, flagged online.

## Final Note
This task helped me realize how easily a malicious extension can steal data or track activity silently. From now on, I’ll stick to trusted, verified add-ons only.
